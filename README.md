# Saaee-AWS
Repository for our cloud computing project.

SAAEE(SAI) is a Korean word which means connections and in this period of life its difficult to make
new connections. This moment in our life is extremely stressful, and everyone's coping technique is
unique. It can be tough for people to express their feelings freely to family members. On the other
side, studies suggest that talking to individuals who are like mined is beneficial.
SAAEE is a social media platform, but it is specifically developed for students and professionals to
discuss their concerns about the changing work culture with others who are experiencing the same
challenges. We do not collect personal information at SAAEE, thus you do not need to be concerned
about security. You may select one of three categories: Students, Professionals, or Freelancers, and
you will be suggested posts that are more relevant to your interests. You may browse other users'
postings, comment on them, and speak with any person one on one if you wish.
Because SAAEE is an anonymous sharing platform, we considered employing Natural Language
Processing techniques to do sentiment analysis as well as to filter out any information that is
potentially harmful to our users. We are especially concerned with eliminating any form of
inflammatory language or bullying conduct.

Three major benefits of using a safe and anonymous sharing platform.
Openness: Everyone is equal; removing the ability for participants to see one other removes a lot of
information that we use to develop preconceptions, create social rank, and fit people into
stereotypes. Everyone engages on a more level playing field, making it much simpler to gather a
diverse variety of viewpoints.
Efficiency: What you see in an online context is individuals offering their ideas much more rapidly;
there is much less need to warm them up because they are empowered to communicate what they
believe without being condemned.
Honesty: Consumers are more relaxed in the comfort of their homes, filling time on a holiday,
making the most of their lunch break - participants choose to participate wherever is convenient,
making them more calm and allowing simple access to their actual sentiments.
